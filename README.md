# db-api-server
Create, document and prototype database applications at "user level" in near realtime (live).

Here you'll find all the material used on a presentation about **Prototype applications**.

It uses a custom build of the scripting language SquiLu [https://github.com/mingodad/squilu](https://github.com/mingodad/squilu),
the build is done using the docker image from [https://github.com/hone/mruby-cli](https://github.com/hone/mruby-cli)
with the Makefile supplied here.

There is two sample sqlite3 databases used for the presentation **todo_tutorial.db** and **todo.db**,
it also uses [https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner](https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner)
for show the entity relationship diagrams.

Also you'll find ready to run executables for android (armv7 using termux [https://github.com/termux/termux-app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)),
android apk (armv7, x86), linux (32 and 64 bits), osx (darwin 32 and 64 bits), windows (mingw 32 and 64 bits), ios (armv7 command line 32 bits).

I'm providing this in hope it can be usefull to others, if you have any suggestion, comments to improve it please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.

The main development was done on linux.

Cheers !
